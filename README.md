***How long did you spend on the test? Would you do anything differently if you had more time?***
I spent around 7 hours working in this project. I'm happy with the structure but ff I had more time I would test a few more styling options of the form fields and another version on mobile containing all the questions in the same screen. (I had an option like that but I wasn't happy with the result - would need more time to test and combine different snippets)

***Describe what you see as the biggest change you made to improve usability of this design.***
The colours and the typography hirearchy help to structure the content clearly: shadows to make the form fields standing out, obvious indicators of a disabled field and how to proceed or back to questions. Typography hierarchy helps to distinguish what is a question answered, a disabled field and the result. I believe all these assets are making this design user friendly.

***Would you be able to code a prototype of this design using HTML and CSS?***
Yes.

***What typeface best describes your personality?***
Helvetica
